  desc 'Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be altered by unauthorized users without detection.

Remote access (e.g., RDP) is access to DOD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, nonorganization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography, enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash.

OL 8 incorporates systemwide crypto policies by default. The employed algorithms can be viewed in the "/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssl.config" file.'

$ sudo fips-mode-setup --check
FIPS mode is enabled.

If FIPS mode is not enabled, this is a finding.

If any other lines are returned by the above command, run the following command to view the currently applied crypto-policy:

$ update-crypto-policies --show
